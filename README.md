## What I build
I'm Christopher — a Computer Science student focused on reproducible, automation-first systems.
I like projects that are deterministic, easy to run, and designed for auditability.

## Start here
- **Flagship:** [Nexus Lab Tracker](https://github.com/chrisdudley-dev/nexus-lab-tracker) — CLI-first lab tracking with reproducible snapshot exports
- **IoT:** [Smart Edge Cloud Thermohygrometer](https://github.com/chrisdudley-dev/smart-edge-cloud-thermohygrometer) — Raspberry Pi monitoring pipeline to AWS

## Highlights
- Deterministic scripts + repeatable setup
- Logging + verification for exports/backups
- Security-minded defaults (no secrets committed)

## Current focus
Nexus Lab Tracker: tightening the demo path (quickstart, tests, and one clear end-to-end workflow).
