## What I build
I’m Christopher — a Computer Science student focused on **reproducible, automation-first systems**.
I like projects that are *deterministic*, easy to run, and designed for **auditability**.

## Featured work
- **Nexus Lab Tracker** — a mini-LIMS + CLI→API workflows with reproducible snapshots  
  → https://github.com/chrisdudley-dev/nexus-lab-tracker
- **Smart Edge-to-Cloud Thermohygrometer** — Raspberry Pi IoT monitoring + AWS  
  → https://github.com/chrisdudley-dev/smart-edge-cloud-thermohygrometer
- **Algorithms & data structures** — learning projects with clear problem statements and tests  
  (I’m gradually consolidating these into fewer, higher-quality repos.)

## Engineering principles I care about
- ✅ Deterministic scripts and repeatable workflows  
- ✅ Logging + verification (backup, export, diffable changes)  
- ✅ Security-minded defaults (least-privilege tokens, no secrets in repos)
